    shortcuts, allowing you to quickly access features without relying on your
    mouse.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're using multimedia content, consider utilizing the full capabilities
    of your application by incorporating video playback features and interactive
    graphics. This maximizes the immersive experience offered by fullscreen
    mode.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that during fullscreen mode, you can still interact with
    various elements of your application, such as forms and interactive
    dashboards, which can greatly enhance your productivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    For applications that require user input, ensure that all interactive
    elements are easily accessible, as the fullscreen experience may alter how
    users interact with your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, consider providing users with a tutorial or tips on how to make the
    most of their experience while in fullscreen mode. This can help users
    discover features they may not have known about, enhancing their overall
    experience.
